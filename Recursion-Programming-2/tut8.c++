// Question -> Jumps â€“ Number of ways to reach destination

/* Problem: You are given a staircase, you need to find the total number of ways to reach the nth stair from the bottom of the staircase when you are only allowed to climb 1, 2 or 3 stairs at a time.

Problem description: The problem needs you to find total possible ways through which we can reach our destination, we are allowed to take a stride of a maximum of 3 jumps from the current position. You are required to develop a certain algorithm that can find the total possible arrangement such that you can reach your destination in minimum possible time constraints.

Input: The first test case of input is the T number of the test case, each test case consists of a single integer the nth stair.

Output: Print the number of ways to reach nth stair from bottom in a new line for each test case.

Examples:
Input:
T = 1
N = 4

Output:
7, total possible ways:
1+1+1+1
1+1+2
1+2+1
1+3
2+1
2+2
3+1
